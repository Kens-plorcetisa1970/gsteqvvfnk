Just stumbled out of the theater. Wow. What the heck did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? Cleaner was like a fever dream. Still picking popcorn crumbs out of my sweater. The whole thing was a whirlwind. The theater was packed, smelled like old candy and spilled soda.

The scenes kept flipping like one of those flip books we made in school, but instead of a funny little cartoon, it was disjointed flashes of chaos. You remember how we used to draw those? My back is still aching from that old creaky seat; felt like I was riding a wooden rollercoaster without the thrill.

> There was this moment, right? Where the protagonist—what was his name again?—descends, literally like an elevator but also in his mind. Like inception but with more dust and regrets. It kinda felt like someone threw all their mental laundry in a washing machine and 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ed it tumbling around.

The music was sharp, almost cutting. At one point, it sounded like a cat slipped onto a keyboard during recording. Absolutely bizarre. Had this odd feeling like I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a dream about bananas peeling themselves. But also kinda like real life? Like sometimes you’re just a bystander in your own mess, and there was this bizarre comfort in it.

Oh! Remember someone mentioned I should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   before seeing it? Yeah, tell them to just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 it, enveloped by the atmosphere, it’s a whole different beast. Makes you question if you cleaned up everything you hid under the rug. Real life stuff, you know? 

Wish I could compare it to something, but have you ever tried to explain wind to a person inside a snow globe? That’s what this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 is like. Just... yeah.

And now my brain is fried. Need a nap. Or a really strong drink. Was there even a plot? Or was it all just hidden under layers of metaphorical grime? To be honest, I’m not sure if I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 a   or if the   𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 me. The damn thing felt alive. Crazy.

Anyway, I'm gonna hit send. Need to digest this more later. Catch ya soon.
